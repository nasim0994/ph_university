### 9. Directory Structure

```
/src
  /modules
    /car
      carInterface.ts
      carController.ts
      carService.ts
      carModel.ts
      carRoute.ts
    /order
      orderInterface.ts
      orderController.ts
      orderService.ts
      orderModel.ts
      orderRoute.ts
  /config
    index.ts
  app.ts
  server.ts
/package.json
/vercel.json
/.env
```

### 10. Troubleshooting

- **Database Connection Error**: Ensure your MongoDB URL is correct in the `.env` file.
